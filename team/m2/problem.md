# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

For decades, people have loved hiking. However, they take a risk every time they go out, in which they may get lost or injured, and not have cell service to make a necessary phone call to get help. Many people die every year due to this, along with other basic things on the trail, like not being prepared for the weather that they may meet during the trip. 

## Proposed Solution

Our web application, **TrailSafe**, is a way for people to get a good idea on what they will be dealing with on a future hike. TrailSafe will let users enter in the trail they are planning on hiking, and what day/time they will hike it, and TrailSafe will give them all of the necessary info regarding their trip. We will give them information on how much of the trail is covered by cell service, as well as looking at the weather patterns for that location and time, to give advice on what you should bring in terms of equipment.

Key features include:

- **Equipment Advise From Weather Patterns**: Analyzes weather patterns at specific location and time, and gives suggestions on what to bring.
- **SOS Security Feature**: Notifies emergency contact if the user has not completed their hike in a predetermined amount of time

TrailSafe aims to improve the safety preparedness of hikers all around the globe.

## Why This Matters

Even with recent improvements in data coverage and equipment safety, hikers still die every year from being ill-prepared. Building tools for these hikers can make a huge impact on the amount of people getting into bad situations during hiking, which is why TrailSafe is being made. With our app, we aim to help these people better supplement their hiking adventures with safety features that may save them in the future, reducing their overall stress greatly. This can empower hikers to have more confidence in their hiking trips, allowing the community of hikers to enjoy it more and grow.
