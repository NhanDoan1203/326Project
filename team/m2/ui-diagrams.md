## Main Dashboard Screen

The **Main Dashboard** is the first screen users see after logging into the TrailSafe web application. Before starting a trail, it is a central hub for all the essential information hikers need. The dashboard provides quick access to trail details, weather conditions, friends, and safety features, ensuring that users have everything they need at a glance. The layout is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate through various features, such as adding new trails, checking weather updates, and tracking their hiking progress.

Key Elements:

1. **Add New Trails**: A button at the top of the dashboard that lets users add new trails by entering details such as the name, time, and distance.
2. **Begin Trail**: A prominent button that starts the tracking of an existing trail. Once clicked, the user is taken to the trail details page, where they can see current weather and prepare for the hike.
3. **Friends List**: This section displays the user’s friends with options to send messages, check statuses, and invite friends to join a hike.
4. **Trails List**: Provides a list of available trails, displaying key information such as trail location, weather, distance, and the user’s progress. This allows hikers to quickly select a trail and decide which one suits their needs for the day.

**Use Case**:
A hiker logs into TrailSafe to prepare for a hike the next day. From the Main Dashboard, they can check their saved trails, look at the weather forecast, and decide which trail to take. They see that one of their friends is available and send them a message inviting them to the hike. They review the trail list to compare the distances and select a trail that fits within their time frame for the day. If they plan a new trail, they can click "Add New Trails" and input the necessary details. The dashboard allows them to manage all aspects of their hike in one place efficiently.

## Begin Trail Screen

The **Begin Trail Screen** is the core feature of TrailSafe that allows users to start tracking their hike officially. This screen provides all necessary information before heading out on a trail, ensuring that hikers are well-prepared and safe. The interface presents important data such as the current weather, start time, trail name, useful message and items that should be packed. The inclusion of a checklist for hiking essentials ensures that users don’t forget important gear. Before beginning the hike, users are also prompted to confirm their emergency contact information, adding an extra layer of safety.
