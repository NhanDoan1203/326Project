- **Details**: I started by getting rid of all of Prof. Richard's task input stuff that we were using as a reference, and then I changed the navagateToPage feature into the renderPage function. They both do a similar thing, but this new function uses the page components that I added for each individual page. (I added a page component for all of our potential pages)
